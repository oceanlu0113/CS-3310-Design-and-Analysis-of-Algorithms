Be familiar with how to write out step-by-step solutions for the following algorithms. Note that you will be required to show contents of arrays (such as M and P for Chained Matrix Multiplication, distance and F for Prim's, length and touch for Dijkstra's, etc) and draw a tree for Huffman's. 

Binomial Coefficient
Floyd's
Chained Matrix Multiplication
Huffman Code
Job Scheduling
Dijkstra's
Prim's and Kruskal's
Given an algorithm description, be able to come up with a counterexample to show the algorithm isn't optimal. 

Know when we might want to use Prim's vs. Kruskal's
